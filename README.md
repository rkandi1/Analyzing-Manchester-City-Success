# Analyzing-Manchester-City-Success
This is a sample Data Analysis project where I extract data about European football leagues and wrangle the data before doing some exploratory analysis on it. This project seeks to inverstigate Manchester City's improvement over the seasons and the reasons behind it. The analysis can be an insight into how to (or not to) run a football club.
